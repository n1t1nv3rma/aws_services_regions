# MCP server to aws_services_regions
Fast MCP server that helps LLMs to optimally and accurately find list of all AWS services available in AWS regions. 

It has comprehensive information about AWS services and regions. It can help your LLM with any specific questions about AWS Services or Regions. For example:

1. Which AWS services are available in specific regions
2. Which regions support specific AWS services
3. When services were launched in specific regions
4. Information about AWS Local Zones and their parent regions
5. The latest AWS service launches
6. Comparing service availability across regions
7. Finding regions with the most or least services
8. Identifying which services are globally available vs. regionally restricted

For example, it can tell LLMs that:

* US East (N. Virginia/us-east-1) has the most AWS services available (388)
* AWS IAM, CloudWatch, EC2, and S3 are available in all 37 AWS regions
* The newest AWS region appears to be Asia Pacific (Taipei/ap-east-2)
* There are 33 AWS Local Zones connected to parent regions
* Some services like Amazon Q Developer are only available in 2 regions
